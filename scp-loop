#This is probably the best SCP script I have worked on so far - at least if you are looking for a way to make your life easier as a system administrator 
#and you don't have rsync installed. (I will have an rsync script here soon - something that runs over SSH.) 

#!/bin/bash 

logloc="${HOME}/tmp/scp-loop.log" #where you want to store your script log - and I create a tmp folder in my user directory for this 
server="username@domain:/dir/" #The name of the domain you are connecting to along with the directory 

#Files you want processed below. I will try to modify this so that it works with a list but for now this is pretty good as you simply need to enter the files
#into the script below 

files=( 
"*file*"
)

#Array to process file list 
for file in "${files[@]}"; do
     if {
       echo attempting to download "${file}" 
       scp -r -i "/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa" "${server}"/"${file}" ~/downloadedmedia | tee -a "${logloc}" || true 
     };then  
          echo "success !"
          echo processed "${file}" | tee -a "${logloc}"
    else
