# savagelycoolshellscripts
Here is a vast collection of shell scripts I am amassing. When I began this project, it started out with me publishing an assortment of random scripts which in some cases were simple repackings of bash commands. Nothing fancy. Things have changed a bit since then and I am now working my way into a role as a developer for Bodhi Linux. While it is too soon to know where that will ultimately lead, a change of pace and mind set is in order. 

Some of these scripts do not have licenses - like the scripts I have added and will continue to add that are one or two line commands. If you use the rsync command, for instance, you know that the syntax varies a lot depending on the use case and to get it just right for some uses cases requires a unique combination of flags. There is not much to that and the process of me writing an rsync script is not a feat of creative ingenuity. However, some of these scripts do a bit more than that. 

Today I wrote a script called filegrepper. The code searches for file patterns in directories using precise strings and enumerates each file in an output sorted by the lines they are written in per the scripts enumerated. If string "mkdir" is on line fifteen of "directorycreator", the output indicates as much and to make it easier to read, I included the grep feature of string matching highlights. 

A programmer can achieve that goal without a script. You can write a while loop in your terminal and line by line execute the correct code in order and you don't need my permission - nor the permission of any other shell scripter. But if you take what I wrote which I put a tad bit more effort into and say you did it. You go with it at your work site - tell everyone you've got the solution. No, you did not do that, sir. Trust me, I know better. I did that. I will not catch you but dear coder, you will know what you did is dishonest. Do not do that. 

If you want to use my creative scripts, do it and don't pay for it. They are free. But don't be a jerk. If you didn't write the code, don't say you did. Trust me, the short term rewards that come with falsely sought acclaim will prove fleeting and if you are put to the test to replicate work you cannot replicate, it will not go well. Also, I think it would be cool if the aspiring Bash programmer were to write me directly, ask me for help and a collaboration formed. I'd be game for that. 

Anyway - I hope whoever reads this enjoys my code.
